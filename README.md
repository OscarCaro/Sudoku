# Sudoku
Final project for the course "Fundamentals of Programming" from my university: Implementation of the well-known **Sudoku** game 

Note: this project is to be run on **CMD** (no frontend development), however it contains the **full implementation** (backend) of the game. Feel free to use it as a guide for the development of a Sudoku full game
